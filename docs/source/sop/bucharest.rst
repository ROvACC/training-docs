Glossary
^^^^^^^^
If both sectors use the following indication, standard LoA with other boundary sector and SOP the coordination between the sectors are not necessary except for weather cells, congested sectors/airports, aircraft performance limitations.
The transfer with other ATC station inside Romanian Airspace will be used the procedure in “pending release”, to avoid additional workload in relation to the transfer of radar identification and separation on a radar track the accepting unit should not perform the operation of "label assumed" until it has made two-way contact with the traffic and the other ATC.

Process Organization
====================

The operating segment represents the basic organizational form for the provision of ATS, is divided into operating positions in function of the workload that normally weighs on the sector itself and in relation to the structure and type of airspace jurisdiction.

The distribution of tasks between multiple operating positions is to be considered as a technique for sharing the workload, to cope with the needs of supply of services to users, according to various operational contingencies.

The dynamics of work, while respecting specific skills possessed by reason of the rating, it must be characterized by a strongly integrated with each other compensation of any load imbalances that may occur for each position.
