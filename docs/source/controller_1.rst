Radar Separation Inside Bucharest ACC Airspace
**********************************************

General
-------
The minimum horizontal separation is 12 km (6 NM).

In order to enforce minimum horizontal separation, both aircraft must not leave controlled airspace and the separation will apply to both aircraft.

Definitions
-----------
Separation is a generic term describing the action taken by air traffic services to maintain a minimum distance between aircraft in order to reduce the risk of collision. Separation is applied horizontally, either longitudinally or laterally, and vertically. Vertical separation is obtained by asking crews of aircraft to use a standard altimeter (QNH) setting to operate at different flight levels or at different altitudes.

Required separation is described as the minimum distance on each axis of the Cartesian system: vertical, longitudinal, and lateral. This is shown in the diagram below:

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

The Y axis represents longitudinal; the X axis represents lateral and the Z axis represents vertical.

Two aircraft are separated if **AT LEAST ONE** of these distances is maintained. **Any two aircraft must fall within one of the separation cases to be properly separated.** In the case of lateral separation, the minima are declared as a distance in nautical miles (NM) and also in terms of angular difference measured in degrees. Longitudinal separation is declared in units of time (minutes) and also in units of distance (NM, DME distance, RNAV, ADS). Vertically, the minima are declared in meters and feet or Flight Levels (FL).

Distance between aircraft is measured from the end of the radar plot symbol of the first aircraft and the end of the radar plot of the second aircraft.

| **Track** is the magnetic route of an aircraft.
| **Cruise flight**: An aircraft is in cruise flight if it maintains a flight level and is on its own navigation.
| **Parallel Offset**: Flight on an offset tracking. The reference track is considered a respective distance to the right or to the left.
| **Procedural Control (non-radar)**: Control based exclusively on position reports of crews.
| **Radar Control**: Control based on position elements of an aircraft displayed on a radar screen and where separation is done by maintaining a specific horizontal distance (longitudinal and/or lateral) between radar returns on a screen representing the aircraft positions in the airspace.

  Relative tracks:

  | α - the angle between aircraft tracks
  | **SS** - same route strict - α ≤ 10⁰
  | **SA** - same route approximate - 10⁰ < α ≤ 20⁰

Minimum Radar Separation in Area Control
****************************************

Aircraft flying on the same route, in the same direction, in cruise flight
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **minimum longitudinal separation** between two aircraft flying on the same route, in the same  direction, at the same level, in cruise, is 10 NM when:

1. The speed of the aircraft in front is greater or at least equal to the speed of the aircraft behind.
2. The two aircraft are on the same route i.e. angle (α) between tracks is between 0° and 20°.
3. The distance between aircraft is measured as in the diagram below:

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

The longitudinal separation in cruise flight shall be maintained by using a combination of distance monitoring and speed control. All flights shall be checked to ensure that at least 10 NM separation is maintained at all times, using speed control as required to maintain this.

The **minimum lateral separation** between two aircraft flying at the same flight level, in cruise flight, on parallel tracks is 10 NM:

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

For two aircraft in cruise flight, on the same track, traveling in the same direction, at the same level, the flying **parallel offset** should be **laterally separated by a minimum** of 10 NM:

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

This separation may only be used after confirmation from the pilot that the aircraft is properly equipped for **parallel offset**.

The **minimum longitudinal separation** between two aircraft flying the same route, in the same  direction, climbing or descending, at the moment passing the occupied flight level, is 10 NM:

IMAGE PLACEHOLDER

An **occupied flight level** is one where the Mode C altitude report on an aircraft shows it is ±300 feet of the assigned flight level, after 3 consecutive radar returns.

This separation is only applicable for flights climbing/descending passing the flight level occupied by an aircraft maintaining that level. The approval to pass through that level will only be granted after the aircraft has occupied a level below or above that aircraft (i.e. FL310 or FL350 in the case above).  The ATCO will maintain radar longitudinal separation until the aircraft is properly separated vertically.

Convergence separation
----------------------

The **minimum longitudinal separation** of two aircraft flying at the same flight level or in  climb/descent at the time passing the occupied flight level, on convergent tracks, is 10 NM
