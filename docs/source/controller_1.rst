Radar Separation Inside Bucharest ACC Airspace
**********************************************

**General**  
The minimum horizontal separation is 12 km (6 NM) or more.  

In order to enforce minimum horizontal separation, both aircraft must not leave controlled airspace  and the separation will apply to both aircraft.  

**Definitions**  

Separation is a generic term describing the action taken by air traffic services to maintain a  minimum distance between aircraft in order to reduce the risk of collision. Separation is applied  horizontally, either longitudinally or laterally, and vertically. Vertical separation is obtained by asking crews of aircraft to use a standard altimeter (QNH) setting to operate at different flight levels or at  different altitudes.  

Required separation is described as minimum distance on each axis of the Cartesian system: vertical,  longitudinal and lateral. This is shown on the diagram below:
