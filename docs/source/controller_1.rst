Radar Separation Inside Bucharest ACC Airspace
**********************************************

General
-------
The minimum horizontal separation is 12 km (6 NM) or more.

In order to enforce minimum horizontal separation, both aircraft must not leave controlled airspace  and the separation will apply to both aircraft.

**Definitions**

Separation is a generic term describing the action taken by air traffic services to maintain a  minimum distance between aircraft in order to reduce the risk of collision. Separation is applied  horizontally, either longitudinally or laterally, and vertically. Vertical separation is obtained by asking crews of aircraft to use a standard altimeter (QNH) setting to operate at different flight levels or at  different altitudes.

Required separation is described as minimum distance on each axis of the Cartesian system: vertical,  longitudinal and lateral. This is shown on the diagram below:


The Y axis represents longitudinal; the X axis represents lateral and the Z axis represents vertical.

Two aircraft are separated if AT LEAST ONE of these distances is maintained. Any two aircraft must  fall within one of the separation cases to be properly separated. In the case of lateral separation,  the minima are declared as a distance in nautical miles (NM) and also in terms of angular difference  measured in degrees. Longitudinal separation is declared in units of time (minutes) and also in units  of distance (NM, DME distance, RNAV, ADS). Vertically, the minima are declared in meters and feet  or Flight Levels (FL).

Distance between aircraft is measured from the end of the radar plot symbol of the first aircraft and  the end of the radar plot of the second aircraft.

Track is the magnetic route of an aircraft.
Cruise flight: An aircraft is in cruise flight if it maintains a flight level and is on own navigation.
Parallel Offset: Flight on an offset track. The reference track is considered a respective distance to  the right or to the left.
Procedural Control (non-radar): Control based exclusively on position reports of crews.
Radar Control: Control based on position elements of an aircraft displayed on a radar screen and  where separation is done by maintaining a specific horizontal distance (longitudinal and/or lateral)  between radar returns on a screen representing the aircraft positions in airspace.
